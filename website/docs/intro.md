# AI Agent Development Governance Framework

Welcome to __Aegis v2.5.0__ - the first governance framework for consistent, compliant AI agent code generation.

## What is AI Agent Development Governance?

Aegis solves the critical problem of inconsistent, non-compliant AI-generated code by providing governance frameworks
that ensure AI agents generate code that follows your standards and patterns:

- __Constitutional Governance__: Foundational principles with democratic amendment processes
- __Drift Detection & Prevention__: Real-time monitoring of agent behavior and intent alignment
- __Configuration Management__: Team-configurable enforcement levels and feature controls
- __Version Consistency__: Automated validation across all framework files
- __Semantic Interrupt Handling__: Detection and response to user confusion or misalignment
- __Observability & Tracing__: Comprehensive monitoring and execution tracking

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @Aegis-framework/CLI@2.5.0

# Initialize in a project
Aegis-hydrate /path/to/your/project
```text

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Framework orientation
Aegis-orient                    # Quick overview
Aegis-orient detailed          # Comprehensive breakdown

# Live monitoring
Aegis-dashboard                 # Full dashboard
Aegis-dashboard health          # Health check

# Core operations
Aegis-conductor init            # Initialize framework
Aegis-conductor check           # Run compliance checks
```text

## Current Framework Status

import FrameworkStatus from '@site/src/components/FrameworkStatus';

<FrameworkStatus />

## Core Capabilities

The framework currently provides __64 capabilities__ across __4 categories__:

- __🔧 Tools (38)__: CLI utilities, validation tools, enforcement engines
- __🏛️ Core (20)__: Framework foundations, specifications, templates
- __⚖️ Governance (4)__: Constitutional enforcement, semantic interrupts
- __🔗 Integration (2)__: Blueprint implementations, external connections

## Key Features

### Constitutional Governance

- __Constitutional Compliance Enforcer__: Validates framework intelligence claims
- __Intent Enforcement Engine__: Real-time drift prevention and command validation
- __Democratic Amendment Engine__: Formal process for framework evolution

### Safety & Prevention

- __Semantic Interrupt Detector__: Responds to user expressions of confusion
- __Foreground Hang Prevention__: Prevents agent blocking on long-running processes
- __Self-Healing Governance__: Detects and prevents repeat failures

### Observability & Monitoring

- __Framework Capability Mapper__: Auto-discovers and catalogs capabilities
- __Execution Trace Hooks__: Real-time feature usage tracking
- __Live Dashboard__: Comprehensive framework monitoring

## Getting Started

1. __Explore the [Live Dashboard](/dashboard)__ to see current framework status
2. __Browse [Capabilities](./capabilities/overview)__ to understand available features
3. __Review [AI Code Patterns](./blueprints/overview)__ for implementation examples
4. __Check [Evolution Stories](../blog)__ for framework development history

- __For Developers__: Explore the [Capabilities Documentation](./capabilities/overview)
- __For Maintainers__: Review the [Blueprint Registry](./blueprints/overview)

The Aegis Framework is designed to grow with your team while maintaining Constitutional governance and safety
principles. Every capability is monitored, every execution is traced, and every change respects the framework's
foundational principles.
