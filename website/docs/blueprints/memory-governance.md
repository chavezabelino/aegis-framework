# memory-governance Blueprint

## Overview

The `memory-governance` blueprint defines the constitutional integration of the memory subsystem, planned as a strategic capability for Aegis Framework v3.0.0.

## Blueprint Specification

```yaml
name: Memory Governance System
version: 1.0.0
description: Constitutional memory management with dual-layer architecture
scope: core, governance, observability
constitutional_authority: Article IV (Data & Memory Governance)
status: strategic_capability

architecture:
  memory_layers:
    - lite_memory: "High-frequency, short-term operational memory"
    - heavy_memory: "Long-term, constitutional knowledge storage"
  
governance_integration:
  - constitutional_compliance: "All memory operations respect governance rules"
  - democratic_evolution: "Memory patterns inform constitutional amendments"
  - audit_trail: "Complete history of memory operations"

tasks:
  - id: memory-core
    agent: system-agent
    prompt: "Implement dual-layer memory architecture"
    output: framework/memory/
    validation: Performance benchmarks, constitutional compliance
    
  - id: governance-integration
    agent: governance-agent
    prompt: "Integrate memory with constitutional framework"
    output: framework/governance/memory-governance.ts
    validation: Constitutional rule adherence, democratic process integration
    
  - id: observability-hooks
    agent: observability-agent
    prompt: "Add memory operation tracing and monitoring"
    output: framework/observability/memory-traces.ts
    validation: Complete operation coverage, performance impact assessment
```

## Memory Architecture

### Dual-Layer Design

#### Lite Memory
- **Purpose**: High-frequency operational data
- **Retention**: Short-term (session-based)
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed
- **Content**: Current execution context, recent operations, active configurations

#### Heavy Memory
- **Purpose**: Long-term constitutional knowledge
- **Retention**: Persistent across sessions
- **Performance**: Optimized for reliability
- **Content**: Constitutional history, pattern recognition data, framework evolution

### Constitutional Integration

#### Governance Rules
- **Data Integrity**: All memory operations maintain consistency
- **Access Control**: Constitutional authority required for modifications
- **Audit Requirements**: Complete operation history maintained
- **Democratic Evolution**: Memory patterns inform constitutional amendments

#### Compliance Mechanisms
- **Real-time Validation**: Every memory operation checked against rules
- **Automatic Remediation**: Self-healing for detected violations
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learning from constitutional compliance patterns
- **Evidence Collection**: Memory operations provide governance evidence

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (v3.0.0-alpha)
```typescript
interface MemoryCore {
  liteMemory: LiteMemoryEngine;
  heavyMemory: HeavyMemoryEngine;
  governanceLayer: MemoryGovernance;
  observabilityHooks: MemoryTracing;
}

class LiteMemoryEngine {
  // High-frequency operational memory
  store(key: string, value: any, ttl?: number): Promise<void>;
  retrieve(key: string): Promise<any>;
  invalidate(key: string): Promise<void>;
}

class HeavyMemoryEngine {
  // Long-term constitutional memory
  persist(category: string, data: any): Promise<void>;
  query(criteria: MemoryCriteria): Promise<any[]>;
  archive(category: string, criteria: any): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Phase 2: Governance Integration (v3.0.0-beta)
```typescript
class MemoryGovernance {
  validateOperation(operation: MemoryOperation): boolean;
  enforceRetentionPolicies(): Promise<void>;
  auditMemoryUsage(): Promise<AuditReport>;
  democraticEvolution(): Promise<ConstitutionalInsights>;
}
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (v3.0.0-stable)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learning from memory usage patterns
- **Predictive Preloading**: Anticipating memory needs
- **Cross-Session Continuity**: Seamless memory across framework sessions
- **Constitutional Learning**: Memory-informed governance evolution

## Governance Compliance

### Constitutional Authority (Article IV)
- **Data Integrity**: All memory operations maintain consistency
- **Memory Management**: Structured approach to knowledge retention
- **Democratic Evolution**: Memory patterns inform constitutional development

### Observability Requirements
- **Operation Tracing**: Every memory operation logged
- **Performance Monitoring**: Memory system performance tracked
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Governance rule adherence monitored
- **Pattern Analysis**: Usage patterns analyzed for insights

## Validation Criteria

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Lite Memory**: Less than 10ms response time for 95% of operations
- **Heavy Memory**: Less than 100ms response time for complex queries
- **Constitutional Validation**: Less than 5ms overhead for compliance checking
- **System Impact**: Less than 5% impact on overall framework performance

### Constitutional Compliance
- **Rule Adherence**: 100% compliance with constitutional requirements
- **Audit Completeness**: All operations fully auditable
- **Democratic Integration**: Memory patterns contribute to governance evolution
- **Evidence Collection**: Memory operations provide compliance evidence

## Strategic Significance

### Framework Evolution
- **v3.0.0 Foundation**: Memory subsystem as core capability
- **Constitutional Enhancement**: Memory-informed governance evolution
- **Performance Optimization**: Framework-wide memory efficiency
- **User Experience**: Seamless context preservation across sessions

### Long-term Vision
- **Intelligent Framework**: Memory-powered adaptive behavior
- **Constitutional Learning**: Self-improving governance through memory patterns
- **Enterprise Integration**: Scalable memory architecture for large teams
- **Ecosystem Expansion**: Memory-backed third-party integrations

The memory governance blueprint establishes the foundation for constitutional memory management, enabling the framework to maintain context and learn from patterns while respecting governance principles.
