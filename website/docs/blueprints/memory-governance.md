# memory-governance Blueprint

## Overview

The `memory-governance` Blueprint defines the Constitutional integration of the memory subsystem, planned as a strategic
capability for Aegis Framework v3.0.0.

## Blueprint Specification

```yaml
name: Memory Governance System
version: 1.0.0
description: Constitutional memory management with dual-layer architecture
scope: core, governance, observability
constitutional_authority: Article IV (Data & Memory Governance)
status: strategic_capability

architecture:
  memory_layers:
    - lite_memory: "High-frequency, short-term operational memory"
    - heavy_memory: "Long-term, Constitutional knowledge storage"

governance_integration:
  - constitutional_compliance: "All memory operations respect governance rules"
  - democratic_evolution: "Memory patterns inform Constitutional amendments"
  - audit_trail: "Complete history of memory operations"

tasks:
  - id: memory-core
    agent: system-agent
    prompt: "Implement dual-layer memory architecture"
    output: framework/memory/
    validation: Performance benchmarks, Constitutional compliance

  - id: governance-integration
    agent: governance-agent
    prompt: "Integrate memory with Constitutional framework"
    output: framework/governance/memory-governance.ts
    validation: Constitutional rule adherence, democratic process integration

  - id: observability-hooks
    agent: observability-agent
    prompt: "Add memory operation tracing and monitoring"
    output: framework/observability/memory-traces.ts
    validation: Complete operation coverage, performance impact assessment

## Memory Architecture

### Dual-Layer Design

#### Lite Memory

- __Purpose__: High-frequency operational data
- __Retention__: Short-term (session-based)
- __Performance__: Optimized for speed
- __Content__: Current execution context, recent operations, active configurations

#### Heavy Memory

- __Purpose__: Long-term Constitutional knowledge
- __Retention__: Persistent across sessions
- __Performance__: Optimized for reliability
- __Content__: Constitutional history, pattern recognition data, framework evolution

### Constitutional Integration

#### Governance Rules

- __Data Integrity__: All memory operations maintain consistency
- __Access Control__: Constitutional authority required for modifications
- __Audit Requirements__: Complete operation history maintained
- __Democratic Evolution__: Memory patterns inform Constitutional amendments

#### Compliance Mechanisms

- __Real-time Validation__: Every memory operation checked against rules
- __Automatic Remediation__: Self-healing for detected violations
- __Pattern Recognition__: Learning from Constitutional compliance patterns
- __Evidence Collection__: Memory operations provide governance evidence

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (v3.0.0-alpha)

```typescript
interface MemoryCore {
  liteMemory: LiteMemoryEngine
  heavyMemory: HeavyMemoryEngine
  governanceLayer: MemoryGovernance
  observabilityHooks: MemoryTracing
}

class LiteMemoryEngine {
  // High-frequency operational memory
  store(key: string, value: any, ttl?: number): Promise<void>
  retrieve(key: string): Promise<any>
  invalidate(key: string): Promise<void>
}

class HeavyMemoryEngine {
  // Long-term Constitutional memory
  persist(category: string, data: any): Promise<void>
  query(criteria: MemoryCriteria): Promise<any[]>
  archive(category: string, criteria: any): Promise<void>
}
```text

### Phase 2: Governance Integration (v3.0.0-beta)

```typescript
class MemoryGovernance {
  validateOperation(operation: MemoryOperation): boolean
  enforceRetentionPolicies(): Promise<void>
  auditMemoryUsage(): Promise<AuditReport>
  democraticEvolution(): Promise<ConstitutionalInsights>
}
```text

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (v3.0.0-stable)

- __Pattern Recognition__: Learning from memory usage patterns
- __Predictive Preloading__: Anticipating memory needs
- __Cross-Session Continuity__: Seamless memory across framework sessions
- __Constitutional Learning__: Memory-informed governance evolution

## Governance Compliance

### Constitutional Authority (Article IV)

- __Data Integrity__: All memory operations maintain consistency
- __Memory Management__: Structured approach to knowledge retention
- __Democratic Evolution__: Memory patterns inform Constitutional development

### Observability Requirements

- __Operation Tracing__: Every memory operation logged
- __Performance Monitoring__: Memory system performance tracked
- __Constitutional Compliance__: Governance rule adherence monitored
- __Pattern Analysis__: Usage patterns analyzed for insights

## Validation Criteria

### Performance Benchmarks

- __Lite Memory__: Less than 10ms response time for 95% of operations
- __Heavy Memory__: Less than 100ms response time for complex queries
- __Constitutional Validation__: Less than 5ms overhead for compliance checking
- __System Impact__: Less than 5% impact on overall framework performance

### Constitutional Compliance

- __Rule Adherence__: 100% compliance with Constitutional requirements
- __Audit Completeness__: All operations fully auditable
- __Democratic Integration__: Memory patterns contribute to governance evolution
- __Evidence Collection__: Memory operations provide compliance evidence

## Strategic Significance

### Framework Evolution

- __v3.0.0 Foundation__: Memory subsystem as core capability
- __Constitutional Enhancement__: Memory-informed governance evolution
- __Performance Optimization__: Framework-wide memory efficiency
- __User Experience__: Seamless context preservation across sessions

### Long-term Vision

- __Intelligent Framework__: Memory-powered adaptive behavior
- __Constitutional Learning__: Self-improving governance through memory patterns
- __Enterprise Integration__: Scalable memory architecture for large teams
- __Ecosystem Expansion__: Memory-backed third-party integrations

The memory governance Blueprint establishes the foundation for Constitutional memory management, enabling the framework
to maintain context and learn from patterns while respecting governance principles.
