# Core Capabilities

## Overview

The Core category represents __20 capabilities (31%)__ of the framework, providing the foundational architecture and
specifications.

## Key Core Components

### Framework Specifications

- __Framework Core Documents__: Version-specific architecture specifications
- __Constitutional Framework__: Foundational governance principles
- __Version Management__: Semantic versioning and consistency controls

### Template System

- __Agent Instructions Templates__: Standardized AI agent behavior patterns
- __Constitutional Remediation Templates__: Structured problem resolution
- __Blueprint Scaffolding__: Project initialization patterns

### Architectural Foundations

- __Adapter Interface__: Universal tech stack integration
- __Execution Modes__: Configurable enforcement levels (lean, strict, generative)
- __Observability Platform__: Monitoring and tracing infrastructure

### Memory & Learning

- __Memory Core__: Persistent knowledge management
- __Pattern Recognition__: Intelligence gap detection
- __Evolution Learning__: Adaptive framework improvement

## Framework Versions

Core specifications are versioned and maintained:

- __v2.4.0__: Current stable release with semantic interrupts
- __v2.3.0__: Constitutional safeguards enhancement
- __v2.2.0__: Feature configurability system
- __v2.1.0__: Memory governance foundations

## Constitutional Integration

All core capabilities operate under Constitutional authority:

- __Article I__: Core principles and Blueprint primacy
- __Article II__: Framework governance and versioning
- __Article III__: Agent behavior and intent alignment
- __Article IX__: Framework intelligence claims validation

## Development Patterns

Core capabilities follow structured development:

1. __Constitutional Authority__: All changes require Constitutional backing
2. __Semantic Versioning__: Strict version control and documentation
3. __Evidence-Based Validation__: Claims require operational proof
4. __Democratic Evolution__: Community-driven improvement process

Core capabilities provide the stable foundation upon which all other framework features are built.
