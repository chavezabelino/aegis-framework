# Core Capabilities

## Overview

The Core category represents **20 capabilities (31%)** of the framework, providing the foundational architecture and
specifications.

## Key Core Components

### Framework Specifications

- **Framework Core Documents**: Version-specific architecture specifications
- **Constitutional Framework**: Foundational governance principles
- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning and consistency controls

### Template System

- **Agent Instructions Templates**: Standardized AI agent behavior patterns
- **Constitutional Remediation Templates**: Structured problem resolution
- **Blueprint Scaffolding**: Project initialization patterns

### Architectural Foundations

- **Adapter Interface**: Universal tech stack integration
- **Execution Modes**: Configurable enforcement levels (lean, strict, generative)
- **Observability Platform**: Monitoring and tracing infrastructure

### Memory & Learning

- **Memory Core**: Persistent knowledge management
- **Pattern Recognition**: Intelligence gap detection
- **Evolution Learning**: Adaptive framework improvement

## Framework Versions

Core specifications are versioned and maintained:

- **v2.5.0**: Current stable release with semantic interrupts
- **v2.5.0**: Constitutional safeguards enhancement
- **v2.5.0**: Feature configurability system
- **v2.5.0**: Memory governance foundations

## Constitutional Integration

All core capabilities operate under Constitutional authority:

- **Article I**: Core principles and Blueprint primacy
- **Article II**: Framework governance and versioning
- **Article III**: Agent behavior and intent alignment
- **Article IX**: Framework intelligence claims validation

## Development Patterns

Core capabilities follow structured development:

1. **Constitutional Authority**: All changes require Constitutional backing
2. **Semantic Versioning**: Strict version control and documentation
3. **Evidence-Based Validation**: Claims require operational proof
4. **Democratic Evolution**: Community-driven improvement process
