# Governance Capabilities

## Overview

The Governance category represents __4 capabilities (6%)__ of the framework, providing Constitutional enforcement and
democratic governance mechanisms.

## Key Governance Components

### Constitutional Enforcement

- __Constitutional Compliance Enforcer__: Real-time validation of framework intelligence claims
- __Democratic Amendment Engine__: Formal process for Constitutional evolution
- __Semantic Interrupt System__: Detection and response to user confusion signals

### Intent Alignment

- __Intent Enforcement Engine__: Prevents agent drift from declared objectives
- __Semantic Interrupt Detector__: Recognizes 12 patterns of user doubt/confusion
- __Constitutional Reflex Engine__: Orchestrates responses to alignment issues

## Semantic Interrupt System (v2.4.0)

### Detection Patterns

- __Intent Questioning__: "what are you trying to do?", "why are you doing that?"
- __Confusion Signals__: "I don't understand what you're doing", "this doesn't make sense"
- __Redirection Commands__: "stop doing that", "that's not the priority"
- __Meta-Cognitive Queries__: "are you sure?", "prove it"

### Response Actions

- __Halt__: Immediate suspension for critical drift (>60% deviation)
- __Realign__: Adjustment for significant misalignment (>30% drift)
- __Interrupt__: Pause for user clarification (intent doubt)
- __Validate__: Confirm understanding (moderate drift)
- __Checkpoint__: Document state for maintenance

## Constitutional Framework

### Core Principles

1. __Traceability__: Every AI-generated change must be traceable
2. __Observability__: All operations must emit Telemetry
3. __Reproducibility__: Same Blueprint generates identical outputs
4. __Safety__: Production systems require fallback mechanisms
5. __Semantic Versioning__: Strict version control

### Governance Structure

- __Article System__: 11 Constitutional articles covering all aspects
- __Amendment Process__: Democratic proposal, review, vote, ratification
- __Enforcement Modes__: Configurable compliance levels
- __Evidence Requirements__: All intelligence claims require proof

## Democratic Features

### Amendment Process

1. __Proposal__: Formal amendment submission
2. __Review__: Public feedback and evaluation
3. __Vote__: Majority approval by Constitutional delegates
4. __Ratification__: Integration into Constitutional framework

### Community Governance

- __Constitutional Delegates__: Authorized voting members
- __Public Review__: Open feedback on proposed changes
- __Transparency__: All governance decisions are documented
- __Appeals Process__: Mechanism for challenging decisions

## Enforcement Integration

Governance capabilities integrate with all framework operations:

- __Command Validation__: Every operation checked against Constitutional rules
- __Real-time Monitoring__: Continuous compliance assessment
- __Automatic Remediation__: Self-healing for detected violations
- __Learning Integration__: Pattern recognition for prevention improvement

The governance system ensures that AI assistance remains aligned with human intent while maintaining democratic
evolution of the framework itself.
