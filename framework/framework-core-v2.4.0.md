# üèõÔ∏è Aegis Framework Core v2.4.0

**Version__: v2.4.0 (Stable Release)  
**Release Date__: August 8, 2025  
**Constitutional Authority__: Article II (Framework Governance)

---

## Executive Summary

Aegis Framework v2.4.0 introduces a comprehensive Semantic Interrupt Reflex System. This capability provides systematic
detection and response to user expressions of doubt about AI agent intent alignment, treating user confusion as a
trigger for Constitutional enforcement.

### Core Innovation

The Semantic Interrupt Reflex System detects natural language cues like "what are you trying to do?" and triggers drift
diagnostics, realignment protocols, and structured recovery options to address systematic intelligence failures through
framework awareness.

### Approach

- Systematic detection of user confidence loss through semantic pattern recognition
- Constitutional integration of semantic interrupt detection as enforcement mechanism
- Real-time validation of intent alignment with <2 second response times
- Evidence-based prevention of agent drift with operational demonstration

## Semantic Interrupt Reflex System

### Semantic Interrupt Detection

Pattern recognition system that identifies user expressions of doubt, confusion, or frustration:

**Detection Patterns__:

- __Intent Questioning__: "what are you trying to do?", "why are you doing that?" (90-95% confidence)
- __Confusion Signals__: "I don't understand what you're doing", "this doesn't make sense" (80-85% confidence)
- __Redirection Commands__: "stop doing that", "that's not the priority" (85-95% confidence)
- __Meta-cognitive Cues__: "you're overthinking this", "let's step back" (70-80% confidence)

### __‚ö° Constitutional Reflex Engine**

Context-aware response system with five distinct reflex actions:

1. __üõë halt__: Immediate cessation for critical drift (>60% deviation, critical urgency)
2. __üîÑ realign__: Significant course correction (goal confusion, >30% drift)
3. __üîç interrupt__: Intent clarification (intent doubt scenarios)
4. __‚úÖ validate__: Alignment verification (moderate drift detection)
5. __üìç checkpoint__: State documentation (maintenance scenarios)

### __üìä Drift Diagnostic Engine**

Automated analysis system that:

- Compares current objectives with original Blueprint baselines
- Calculates drift percentage using semantic similarity analysis
- Generates context-specific recommendations for realignment
- Provides multiple recovery pathway options with impact assessment

### __üõ°Ô∏è Constitutional Integration**

Seamlessly integrated into the Constitutional enforcement pipeline as the __9th safeguard layer__, providing:

- Real-time processing of user input for semantic interrupts
- Meta-cognitive awareness of framework alignment state
- Evidence-based validation of agent drift prevention capability
- Structured response protocols with user-friendly realignment prompts
