## 🏛️ Constitutional Compliance

**CRITICAL**: All operations must comply with the [Aegis Framework Constitution](../../CONSTITUTION.md). This includes:

- **Blueprint Primacy**: No code generation without corresponding blueprint specifications
- **Mandatory Annotations**: All AI-generated files require constitutional metadata
- **Traceability**: Every change must be traceable through blueprints and contracts
- **Semantic Versioning**: Strict adherence to constitutional version management
