## 🏛️ Constitutional Compliance

**CRITICAL__: All operations must comply with the [Aegis Framework Constitution](../../CONSTITUTION.md). This includes:

- __Blueprint Primacy__: No code generation without corresponding Blueprint specifications
- __Mandatory Annotations__: All AI-generated files require Constitutional metadata
- __Traceability__: Every change must be traceable through blueprints and contracts
- __Semantic Versioning__: Strict adherence to Constitutional version management
