# üìú Constitutional Amendment Proposal: Article IX - Self-Healing Governance

## üèõÔ∏è Amendment Overview

**Proposal ID__: AMEND-001-SELF-HEALING  
**Proposed Date__: August 5, 2025  
**Constitutional Authority__: Article VII (Amendment Process)  
**Impact Level__: Major enhancement with new enforcement powers

## üéØ Proposed Amendment Text

### __Article IX: Self-Healing Governance**

#### __Section 1: Constitutional Monitoring**

The framework shall continuously monitor its own Constitutional compliance through:

1. __Automated Constitutional Audits__: Regular compliance assessments across all framework components
2. __Real-time Drift Detection__: Immediate identification of Constitutional violations as they occur
3. __Compliance Scoring__: Quantitative measurement of framework Constitutional health
4. __Violation Logging__: Complete audit trail of all Constitutional infractions

#### __Section 2: Enforcement Authority**

The Constitutional Conductor (`Aegis-conductor` CLI) is hereby established as the primary enforcement mechanism with
authority to:

1. __Detect Constitutional Violations__: Automatically identify deviations from Constitutional requirements
2. __Apply Safe Auto-corrections__: Implement corrections for predetermined safe violation types
3. __Block Non-compliant Changes__: Prevent Constitutional violations from entering the framework
4. __Generate Compliance Reports__: Provide transparency through comprehensive Constitutional reporting

#### __Section 3: Self-Correction Principles**

All automated Constitutional corrections must adhere to these immutable principles:

1. __Dry-run by Default__: All enforcement actions must preview changes before application
2. __Human Oversight__: Significant Constitutional changes require explicit human approval
3. __Complete Audit Trail__: Every enforcement action must be logged with full context
4. __Rollback Capability__: All automated changes must be reversible
5. __Origin Tracking__: Every change must declare its origin (human, agent, conductor, auto)

#### __Section 4: Drift Management**

Constitutional drift shall be managed through:

1. __Automatic Detection__: Real-time identification of Constitutional deviations
2. __Categorization__: Classification by type, severity, and corrective complexity
3. __Pattern Analysis__: Recognition of recurring violation patterns for prevention
4. __Predictive Prevention__: Proactive measures to prevent Constitutional drift before occurrence

#### __Section 5: Democratic Evolution**

Self-healing governance must maintain democratic principles:

1. __Community Oversight__: Constitutional enforcement subject to community review
2. __Amendment Transparency__: All Constitutional changes logged and reviewable
3. __Governance Limits__: Conductor cannot modify Constitutional text without human approval
4. __Emergency Procedures__: Crisis protocols maintain Constitutional integrity under Article VII
