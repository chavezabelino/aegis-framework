# Constitutional Amendment XI: AI Agent Drift Prevention

## ðŸ“œ Amendment Proposal

**Proposed Date**: August 6, 2025  
**Framework Version**: 2.0.0-alpha-dev  
**Trigger**: Field-identified gap in agent Constitutional compliance  
**Evolution Story**: EVS-2025-08-06-002 (Agent Drift Prevention)

## ðŸŽ¯ Constitutional Addition

### Article XI: AI Agent Constitutional Compliance

#### Section 1: Agent Intent Declaration

All AI agents operating within the Aegis Framework must declare execution intent before performing any actions. This
declaration shall include:

1. **Primary Goal**: Clear statement of the agent's objective
2. **Blueprint Context**: Reference to governing Blueprint (if applicable)
3. **Execution Mode**: Framework mode (lean/strict/generative)
4. **Expected Actions**: List of anticipated functional operations
5. **Forbidden Actions**: Constitutional constraints and prohibited operations

#### Section 2: Real-Time Intent Enforcement

The framework shall provide mandatory real-time enforcement mechanisms:

1. **Pre-Execution Validation**: All commands must pass Constitutional compliance checks
2. **Functional Requirement**: Demonstrative commands (e.g., echo) are prohibited when functional actions are intended
3. **Traceability Requirement**: Every action must be traceable to declared intent and Constitutional principles
4. **Violation Detection**: Automatic detection and blocking of intent drift patterns

#### Section 3: Agent Drift Prevention Standards

##### **Prohibited Patterns**

- Using echo commands when functional testing is required
- Executing commands without clear Constitutional purpose
- Bypassing validation requirements through non-functional alternatives
- Performing actions not aligned with declared intent

##### **Required Safeguards**

- Intent enforcement engine validation before all command execution
- Constitutional compliance checking for all file modifications
- Automatic violation detection and blocking mechanisms
- Session logging and audit trails for all agent actions

#### Section 4: Enforcement Mechanisms

##### **Technical Implementation**

- `IntentEnforcementEngine`: Mandatory pre-execution validation
- `ConstitutionalAIAgent`: Wrapper class enforcing compliance
- Pre-commit hooks preventing Constitutional violations
- CI/CD integration blocking non-compliant changes

##### **Violation Consequences**

- **Warning Level**: Agent coaching and corrective guidance
- **Error Level**: Action blocking and intent clarification requirement
- **Critical Level**: Session suspension and Constitutional review

#### Section 5: Agent Session Requirements

##### **Session Initialization**

- Constitutional intent declaration
- Framework version compliance verification
- Tool manifest validation
- Safety constraint acknowledgment

##### **Session Monitoring**

- Real-time command analysis and intent alignment scoring
- Constitutional violation detection and prevention
- Action logging with Constitutional metadata
- Automatic violation reporting and escalation

##### **Session Completion**

- Constitutional compliance report generation
- Intent fulfillment verification
- Violation summary and remediation recommendations
- Evolution story trigger documentation

#### Section 6: Integration Requirements

##### **Framework Integration**

- All AI agents must use Constitutional wrapper classes
- Pre-execution validation is mandatory for all actions
- Constitutional annotations required in all generated files
- Blueprint traceability enforcement

##### **Development Workflow Integration**

- Git hooks enforce Constitutional compliance
- CI/CD pipelines include intent validation
- Code review processes verify Constitutional adherence
- Evolution story generation for Constitutional gaps

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Provisions

### Immediate Effect

This amendment takes effect immediately upon ratification to address active agent drift risks.

### Grandfather Clause

Existing AI-generated code has 30 days to be updated with Constitutional annotations or undergo Constitutional review.

### Emergency Override

In cases of critical system failures, Constitutional review board may grant temporary exemptions with mandatory
post-incident Constitutional assessment.

## ðŸ“Š Implementation Requirements

### Phase 1: Immediate (0-7 days)

- Deploy intent enforcement engine
- Activate Constitutional AI agent wrappers
- Install pre-commit Constitutional hooks
- Update CI/CD with Constitutional compliance

### Phase 2: Integration (7-30 days)

- Update all existing AI tools with Constitutional wrappers
- Implement framework-wide intent declaration requirements
- Deploy Constitutional violation monitoring
- Train development teams on Constitutional agent usage

### Phase 3: Enforcement (30+ days)

- Full Constitutional compliance enforcement
- Evolution story generation for all Constitutional gaps
- Regular Constitutional audit cycles
- Constitutional compliance metrics and reporting

## ðŸ”„ Ratification Process

### Constitutional Authority

This amendment is proposed under Article VII (Amendment Process) of the Aegis Framework Constitution.

### Required Approvals

- Framework maintainer review
- Constitutional compliance validation
- Technical implementation verification
- Community feedback integration

### Implementation Validation

- All Constitutional validation tools must pass
- Intent enforcement system must be functional
- Pre-commit hooks must be operational
- CI/CD Constitutional checks must be active
