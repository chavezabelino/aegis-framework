## [1.3.0] - 2025-08-05

### Added - Apprenticeship Scaffolds for Junior Developers
- **Apprenticeship execution modes**: `@apprenticeshipMode` contexts (guided, challenge, review-only) for blueprints and CLI
- **Blueprint reflection blocks and prompts**: Schema extension for learning objectives, reflection, and progress tracking
- **Observability events**: Dedicated `framework/observability/apprenticeship-events.jsonl` for apprenticeship telemetry and learning signals
- **Ghost Mentor plugin**: Automated feedback and review system for apprenticeship workflows (`framework/mentors/ghost-mentor-plugin.ts`)
- **CLI support**: `cli/apprenticeship-cli.ts` and compiled CLI for running apprenticeship workflows with event emission and mentor feedback
- **Replay and snapshot tests**: Deterministic output validation and learning delta tracking (`tests/snapshot-tests/apprenticeship-scaffolds.test.ts`, `tests/replay-diff-tests/apprenticeship-scaffolds-replay.test.ts`)
- **Constitutional compliance**: All scaffolds, events, and plugins include required annotations and follow blueprint-driven traceability

#### Migration Notes
- No breaking changes. Existing blueprints are unaffected unless adopting apprenticeship scaffolds.
- See `docs/implementation/apprenticeship-scaffolds.md` for usage, extension, and compliance guidance.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-08-05

### Added - Enhanced Blueprint Auto-Repair (ML Optimization)
- **ML-driven error detection and repair**: `framework/healing/auto-repair-ml-engine.ts` with rule-based and extensible pattern recognition
- **Context-sensitive auto-fixes**: Automated repair for missing/invalid blueprint fields (id, version, content)
- **Observability event emission**: All repair actions are logged to `framework/observability/events.jsonl` for audit and replay
- **Constitutional compliance**: Full traceability, error handling, and fallback for all auto-repair actions
- **Extensible design**: Ready for future ML model/plugin integration

#### Migration Notes
- No breaking changes. Existing blueprints will be auto-repaired if missing required fields or types.
- See `docs/implementation/auto-repair-ml-engine.md` for usage and extension guidance.
