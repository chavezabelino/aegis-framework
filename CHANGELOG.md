## [2.4.0] - 2025-08-08

### üß† **Semantic Interrupt Reflex System: BREAKTHROUGH CAPABILITY**

- **NEW**: Real-time detection of expressions like "what are you trying to do?", "stop doing that", "why are you doing that?"
- **NEW**: Intent checkpoint system with persistent storage for drift comparison baseline
- **NEW**: Automated drift diagnostic with percentage calculation between current and original objectives
- **RESULT**: **<2 second response time** for detection + diagnostic + structured response generation

- **NEW**: **realign** action for significant misalignment (goal confusion, >30% drift) 
- **NEW**: **interrupt** action for intent clarification (intent doubt scenarios)
- **NEW**: **validate** action for alignment verification (moderate drift detection)
- **NEW**: **checkpoint** action for state documentation and maintenance
- **RESULT**: **Context-specific user prompts** with structured realignment protocols

#### **üõ°Ô∏è Constitutional Integration: ENHANCED SAFEGUARDS**
