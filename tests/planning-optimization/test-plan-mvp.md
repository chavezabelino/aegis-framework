# Test MVP Plan - Planning Optimization Validation

## 1) Contracts
- [ ] Planning optimization system validates plan constraints correctly (observable behavior)
- [ ] Plan gate enforces token and file count limits (behavioral validation)
- [ ] Constitutional annotations are properly validated (user-facing compliance)

## 2) Changes (≤ 2 files)
- File: `tests/planning-optimization/test-plan-mvp.md` — create test plan for validation
- File: `tests/planning-optimization/test-plan-surgical.md` — create test plan for surgical validation

## 3) Tests
- E2E: validate plan gate passes for MVP plan
- E2E: validate plan gate fails for oversized plan
- E2E: validate planner critic compares plans correctly

## 4) Risks & Rollback
- Risk: Test plans may not represent real-world usage patterns
- Rollback: revert test files if validation issues arise

## 5) Done When
- [ ] MVP plan passes plan gate validation
- [ ] Surgical plan passes plan gate validation
- [ ] Planner critic successfully compares test plans
- [ ] All planning optimization tools work as expected
