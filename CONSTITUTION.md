Constitution-Version: 2.5.1

## AI Agent Development Governance Charter

## Preamble

This document establishes the foundational principles, governance structures, and evolutionary processes for the AI Agent
Development Governance Framework. It serves as the central authority for governing AI agent code generation, ensuring
consistency, traceability, and structured evolution of AI-assisted development.

## Article I: Core Principles

### Section 1: Fundamental Values

The AI Agent Development Governance Framework is founded upon these principles:

1. **Traceability**: Every AI-generated change must be traceable through AI code patterns and contracts

2. **Observability**: All framework operations must emit Telemetry and be auditable

3. **Reproducibility**: Same AI code pattern must generate identical outputs deterministically

4. **Safety**: Production AI systems must include fallback mechanisms and error handling

5. **Semantic Versioning**: All changes follow strict semantic versioning principles

### Section 2: AI Code Pattern Primacy

AI code patterns serve as the source of truth for AI agent code generation. All AI agents must follow approved patterns
to ensure consistent, compliant code output.

## Article II: Framework Governance

## üìê Article XI: Field-Driven Abstraction Principle

### Section 1: Framework Evolution Boundaries

The Aegis Framework exists as a **constitutional governance system** providing abstract patterns and enforcement
mechanisms, not project-specific technical solutions.

#### **Constitutional Framework Scope**

All framework evolution must operate within these boundaries:

**‚úÖ Framework Evolution (Constitutional)**

- Abstract patterns applicable across technology stacks

- ConstitutionalConstitutional enforcement mechanisms

- Universal governance structures

- Systematic prevention of constitutional violations

- Meta-patterns that guide development practices

**‚ùå Project Assistance (Non-Constitutional)**

- Technology-specific implementation guidance

- Project-specific debugging solutions

- Individual technical problem resolution

- Stack-specific tutorials or examples

- One-off fixes for particular implementations

### Section 2: Field Feedback Classification

All field-driven insights must be classified and processed according to constitutional scope:

#### **Systemic Framework Gaps** (Constitutional)

- Missing fundamental Blueprint coverage

- Absent constitutional enforcement mechanisms

- Structural governance weaknesses

- Abstract pattern deficiencies

#### **Individual Implementation Issues** (Non-Constitutional)

- Technology-specific errors

- Project configuration problems

- Stack-specific integration challenges

- Individual learning and adoption friction

### Section 3: Evolution Story Requirements

Evolution stories must demonstrate **universal applicability**:

#### **Required Constitutional Elements**

- Abstract pattern identification that benefits all future projects

- ConstitutionalConstitutional governance improvements

- Systematic framework enhancements

- Universal enforcement mechanisms

#### **Prohibited Project-Specific Elements**

- Technology stack-specific solutions

- Individual project guidance

- Implementation-specific fixes

- Localized technical assistance

### Section 4: Framework Purity Enforcement

The framework maintains constitutional integrity through:

#### **Abstraction Validation**

- All proposed changes must demonstrate universal applicability

- Solutions must transcend individual technology choices

- Improvements must strengthen constitutional governance

- Enhancements must prevent systematic issues, not solve individual cases

#### **Scope Boundary Protection**

- Framework evolution rejected if it provides project-specific solutions

- ConstitutionalConstitutional amendments require demonstration of universal benefit

- Evolution stories validated for abstraction level compliance

- Field feedback filtered through constitutional relevance assessment

### Section 5: Constitutional Authority and Precedent

This article establishes framework evolution principles based on EVS-2025-01-15-001, which demonstrated the critical
distinction between:

- **Framework constitutional improvements** that prevent systematic drift across all projects

- **Individual project assistance** that solves specific technical implementation challenges

#### **Enforcement Mechanisms**

- Evolution story constitutional compliance validation

- Framework change abstraction level assessment

- Field feedback classification requirements

- ConstitutionalConstitutional scope boundary monitoring

#### **Precedent Establishment**

EVS-2025-01-15-001 serves as the foundational precedent demonstrating proper field-driven abstraction:

- Field experience revealed **systematic framework gaps** (missing authentication Blueprints)

- ConstitutionalConstitutional response created **universal solutions** (tech-agnostic authentication patterns)

- Framework evolution benefited **all future projects** (constitutional enforcement mechanisms)

- No project-specific technical solutions were provided

**Ratification Date**: January 15, 2025

**Constitutional Authority**: Article X (Field-Driven Evolution Documentation) + EVS-2025-01-15-001

**Enforcement**: Article VIII (Validation Tools) + Constitutional Compliance Gates

## üßæ Article XIII: Evidence-Driven Production Readiness

### Section 1: Production-Ready = Evidence, Not Claims

- A change SHALL be considered production-ready only when ALL of the following are true:

  1. A Production-Ready Evidence Contract (PREC) exists at `blueprints/<id>/evidence.json`, and CI MUST execute it (not just check it in).

  2. The following CI jobs MUST pass and SHALL be configured as required status checks on `main`:

     - `validate_blueprint`

     - `check_provenance`

     - `check_paths`

     - `check_version`

     - `prove_evidence`

     - `vr_tests`

  3. All changed artifacts MUST include provenance (header or sidecar) and CI SHALL recompute sha256 (excluding the `@hash` line, LF-normalized) and MUST verify HMAC signatures stored at `.aegis/attestations/<commit>/<relpath>.sig`.

  4. CI MUST produce and upload a governance report artifact generated by `node tools/generate-governance-report.ts`.

- No Artifact, No Green: Agents SHALL NOT assert production-ready status without uploaded receipts.

### Section 2: Provenance & Attestation

- Every AI-generated artifact MUST include the following provenance fields (header or sidecar for non-commentable files):

  - `@aegisBlueprint`, `@version`, `@mode`, `@intent`, `@context`, `@model`, `@hash`.

- CI SHALL recompute `sha256(body)` with LF line endings and with the `@hash` line excluded, and SHALL verify an HMAC signature using `$AEGIS*HMAC*KEY` written to `.aegis/attestations/<commit>/<relpath>.sig`. Any mismatch MUST fail CI.

- Non-commentable files (e.g., JSON/YAML/images) MUST include a sidecar `path.ext.prov.json` with the same provenance fields.

### Section 3: PREC (Production-Ready Evidence Contract)

- PREC files MUST:

  - Conform to the documented JSON schema.

- List commands CI MUST execute, and expected outputs CI MUST verify: existence, size > 0, and modification time > job
start, plus sha256 hash.

  - Be located at `blueprints/<id>/evidence.json`.

### Section 4: Visual Regression Policy

- Baselines SHALL be stored under `.aegis/vr-baselines/`.

- The visual diff threshold SHALL be `0.01` (1%). Diffs exceeding threshold MUST fail the job.

- CI MUST upload VR reports/baselines as artifacts.

### Section 5: ATS Telemetry

- Implementations MUST emit ATS events `planning.detected`, `planning.validated`, `planning.selected`, `planning.rejected` as NDJSON under `.aegis/telemetry/`.

- CI MUST upload Telemetry artifacts.

### Section 6: Ready Label Gate

- Only CI MAY apply the label `ready:production`, and ONLY after all governance jobs succeed.

### Section 7: Red‚ÜíGreen Proof for Governance Upgrades

- Each governance upgrade MUST demonstrate:

  - One failing CI run (seeded violation), and one passing CI run (fix applied).

  - Both MUST attach governance reports and artifacts.

### Section 8: Reusable Governance Workflow

- Consumers MUST use the reusable governance workflow by tag: `chavezabelino/aegis-framework/.github/workflows/aegis-governance-reusable.yml@<version>`
  

- Profile selection MUST be documented in the repository's governance setup

- Copying governance workflows is PROHIBITED; all consumers MUST use the reusable workflow

- The reusable workflow provides three profiles:

  - `lite`: Fast checks for development (typecheck, lint, test, provenance headers)

  - `standard`: Production-ready validation (includes evidence proving)

  - `core`: Maximum security (includes visual regression testing)

### Section 9: Change Control

- ConstitutionalConstitutional changes to governance SHALL require CODEOWNERS review on:

  - `.github/workflows/**`, `tools/**`, `CONSTITUTION.md`, `docs/aegis/**`, `.cursorrules`.

- Constitution-Version MUST be bumped and a changelog entry recorded with each amendment.
