# üèõÔ∏è Aegis Framework Constitution

## üìú Preamble

This document establishes the foundational principles, governance structures, and evolutionary processes for the Aegis Framework. It serves as the supreme authority for all framework decisions, ensuring consistency, traceability, and democratic evolution of the AI-native engineering ecosystem.

## üéØ Article I: Core Principles

### Section 1: Fundamental Values
The Aegis Framework is founded upon these immutable principles:

1. **Traceability**: Every AI-generated change must be traceable through blueprints and contracts
2. **Observability**: All framework operations must emit telemetry and be auditable
3. **Reproducibility**: Same blueprint must generate identical outputs deterministically
4. **Safety**: Production AI systems must include fallback mechanisms and error handling
5. **Semantic Versioning**: All changes follow strict semantic versioning principles

### Section 2: Blueprint Primacy
Blueprints are the supreme source of truth for all AI-generated code. No code shall be generated without a corresponding blueprint specification.

## üèóÔ∏è Article II: Framework Governance

### Section 1: Version Authority
The current framework version is declared in:
- `VERSION` file (single source of truth)
- `framework/framework-core-v{X.Y.Z}.md` (specification document)
- All framework files via `@aegisFrameworkVersion` annotations

### Section 2: Change Classification
All framework changes shall be classified as:

#### Breaking Changes (Major Version)
- Blueprint schema modifications requiring migration
- Annotation requirement changes
- Framework file structure changes
- CLI interface breaking modifications

#### Feature Additions (Minor Version)
- New blueprint capabilities
- Additional execution modes
- Enhanced validation tools
- New adapter support

#### Improvements (Patch Version)
- Bug fixes and hotfixes
- Documentation enhancements
- Minor CLI improvements
- Validation rule refinements

### Section 3: Specification Authority
Framework specifications shall be maintained as:
- **Current Spec**: `framework/framework-core-v{current}.md`
- **Future Specs**: `framework/versions/framework-core-v{future}-spec.md`
- **Archived Specs**: `framework/versions/framework-core-v{past}.md`

## üîÑ Article III: Evolution Process

### Section 1: Feature Development Workflow
New features must follow this constitutional process:

1. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate against 5-category framework:
   - Agent behavior impact

5. **Validation Requirements**: Include testing and migration strategies

### Section 2: Mandatory Annotations
All AI-generated files must include constitutional metadata:

```markdown
<!--
@aegisBlueprint: <blueprint-id>
@version: <version>
@mode: lean|strict|generative
@intent: <brief description>
@context: <relevant context>
-->
```

Framework files must include:
```markdown
<!--
@aegisFrameworkVersion: <framework-version>

- **Dry-Run Simulation**: High-risk phases must include simulation or preview of effects before execution
- **Tool Validation**: All referenced tools must exist and be validated before plan approval
- **Constitutional Review**: Plans affecting framework structure require constitutional compliance validation

#### **Schema Compliance**
All remediation plans must conform to `RemediationPlan.schema.ts` including:
- Constitutional annotations (`@aegisFrameworkVersion`, `@intent`, `@context`, `@mode`)
- Semantic versioning for plan versions
- Measurable success criteria (minimum 3 criteria including build, test, compliance)
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- CI integration requirements with preflight gates

#### **Preflight Gate Requirements**
Before any remediation plan execution:
1. **Build Validation**: `npm run build` or equivalent must pass
2. **Test Validation**: All existing tests must pass
3. **Lint Validation**: Code style and quality checks must pass
4. **Tool Existence**: All referenced tools must be verified to exist
5. **Schema Validation**: Plan must pass `validate-remediation-plan.ts` checks
