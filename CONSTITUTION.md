# üèõÔ∏è Aegis Framework Constitution

## üìú Preamble

This document establishes the foundational principles, governance structures, and evolutionary processes for the Aegis Framework. It serves as the supreme authority for all framework decisions, ensuring consistency, traceability, and democratic evolution of the AI-native engineering ecosystem.

## üéØ Article I: Core Principles

### Section 1: Fundamental Values
The Aegis Framework is founded upon these immutable principles:

1. **Traceability**: Every AI-generated change must be traceable through blueprints and contracts
2. **Observability**: All framework operations must emit telemetry and be auditable
3. **Reproducibility**: Same blueprint must generate identical outputs deterministically
4. **Safety**: Production AI systems must include fallback mechanisms and error handling
5. **Semantic Versioning**: All changes follow strict semantic versioning principles

### Section 2: Blueprint Primacy
Blueprints are the supreme source of truth for all AI-generated code. No code shall be generated without a corresponding blueprint specification.

## üèóÔ∏è Article II: Framework Governance

### Section 1: Version Authority
The current framework version is declared in:
- `VERSION` file (single source of truth)
- `framework/framework-core-v{X.Y.Z}.md` (specification document)
- All framework files via `@aegisFrameworkVersion` annotations

### Section 2: Change Classification
All framework changes shall be classified as:

#### Breaking Changes (Major Version)
- Blueprint schema modifications requiring migration
- Annotation requirement changes
- Framework file structure changes
- CLI interface breaking modifications

#### Feature Additions (Minor Version)
- New blueprint capabilities
- Additional execution modes
- Enhanced validation tools
- New adapter support

#### Improvements (Patch Version)
- Bug fixes and hotfixes
- Documentation enhancements
- Minor CLI improvements
- Validation rule refinements

### Section 3: Specification Authority
Framework specifications shall be maintained as:
- **Current Spec**: `framework/framework-core-v{current}.md`
- **Future Specs**: `framework/versions/framework-core-v{future}-spec.md`
- **Archived Specs**: `framework/versions/framework-core-v{past}.md`

## üîÑ Article III: Evolution Process

### Section 1: Feature Development Workflow
New features must follow this constitutional process:

1. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate against 5-category framework:
   - Agent behavior impact
   - Blueprint contract changes
   - Developer workflow changes
   - Migration requirements
   - Documentation updates

2. **Version Targeting**: Assign semantic version based on change scope
3. **Specification Creation**: Document in versioned specification file
4. **Implementation Planning**: Break into phases with clear milestones
5. **Validation Requirements**: Include testing and migration strategies

### Section 2: Mandatory Annotations
All AI-generated files must include constitutional metadata:

```markdown
<!--
@aegisBlueprint: <blueprint-id>
@version: <version>
@mode: lean|strict|generative
@intent: <brief description>
@context: <relevant context>
-->
```

Framework files must include:
```markdown
<!--
@aegisFrameworkVersion: <framework-version>
@intent: <purpose of this file>
-->
```

### Section 3: Blueprint Contract Requirements
All blueprints must include:
- **Required**: `id`, `name`, `version`
- **Observability**: Event emission specifications
- **Error Handling**: Fallback state definitions
- **Validation**: Rule contracts with versioning

## üìä Article IV: Quality Assurance

### Section 1: Testing Requirements
- **Snapshot Tests**: Validate blueprint fidelity over time
- **Replay Tests**: Ensure deterministic output regeneration
- **Visual Regression**: Required for all public routes
- **Schema Validation**: All blueprints must pass validation

### Section 2: Documentation Standards
- **Changelog**: Structured, impact-categorized release notes
- **Migration Guides**: Clear upgrade paths for breaking changes
- **Examples**: Working blueprint demonstrations
- **Architecture**: Framework decision documentation

## üöÄ Article V: Release Process

### Section 1: Version Progression
- **Alpha**: Core feature implementation, may have breaking changes
- **Beta**: Feature-complete, API stable, production testing
- **Stable**: Production-ready, comprehensive documentation

### Section 2: Release Requirements
Before any version release:
1. All tests must pass
2. Documentation must be current
3. Migration guides must be provided for breaking changes
4. Changelog must be updated with structured entries
5. Git tags must follow semantic versioning

## üîê Article VI: Backward Compatibility

### Section 1: Compatibility Guarantee
- Patch versions maintain full backward compatibility
- Minor versions maintain API compatibility
- Major versions may introduce breaking changes with migration paths

### Section 2: Deprecation Process
Features marked for removal must:
1. Be deprecated for at least one minor version
2. Include clear migration documentation
3. Provide automated migration tools when possible

## üìã Article VII: Amendment Process

### Section 1: Constitutional Changes
This constitution may only be amended through:
1. Proposal in framework specification
2. Community review and feedback
3. Formal documentation update
4. Version-controlled implementation

### Section 2: Emergency Procedures
In cases of critical security or stability issues:
1. Immediate hotfix deployment is permitted
2. Constitutional compliance review required within 48 hours
3. Retroactive documentation and process updates mandatory

## üé® Article VIII: Enforcement

### Section 1: Validation Tools
The framework provides constitutional enforcement through:
- `tools/validate-blueprint.ts`: Blueprint schema compliance
- `tools/generate-changelog.ts`: Structured changelog generation
- CI/CD validation: Automated constitutional compliance checking

### Section 2: Non-Compliance Consequences
Code that violates constitutional principles:
- Shall not be accepted into the main framework
- Must be remediated before merge approval
- May trigger emergency constitutional review
