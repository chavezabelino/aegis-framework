### Aegis Bundle Builder

- Purpose: produce a deterministic, vendorable `.tar.gz` containing selected Aegis rules/scripts/docs/templates plus a manifest and recommended package scripts.

### Include list

- Authoritative list: `distribution/include.txt`. If your repo guardrails restrict that path, place it at `tools/distribution/include.txt` (the builder will fallback).
- Paths are relative to repo root. Missing entries are warned, not fatal.

### Build

- Script: `tools/distribution/create-aegis-bundle.cjs`
- Output: `dist/aegis-bundles/aegis-<branch>-<shortSha>-<yyyy-mm-dd>.tar.gz`
- Contents:
  - `bundle.manifest.json`: includes commit, branch, createdAt, files[{ path, sha256, size, mode, isExec }]
  - `bundle.package-scripts.json`: subset of recommended `package.json` scripts for additive merge

### Determinism

- No network calls. Exact file set governed by include list. Checksums are SHA-256. Branch/commit captured at build time.

### Usage

```bash
node tools/distribution/create-aegis-bundle.cjs
```

Options:
- `--include <path>`: override include list
- `--out-dir <dir>`: override output directory
