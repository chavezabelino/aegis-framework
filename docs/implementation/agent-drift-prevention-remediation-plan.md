## 📚 Summary

This remediation plan addresses the identified agent drift issue through:

1. **Technical Safeguards**: Intent enforcement engine and constitutional AI agent wrapper
2. **Procedural Safeguards**: Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD integration
3. **Constitutional Safeguards**: Article XI amendment establishing agent compliance requirements
4. **Validation Safeguards**: Comprehensive testing and compliance checking

The plan follows the framework's own constitutional requirements for remediation plans, ensuring safety, traceability,
and constitutional compliance throughout implementation.

**Primary Goal**: Prevent AI agents from drifting from constitutional principles  
**Key Innovation**: Real-time intent enforcement preventing echo commands for functional testing  
**Constitutional Impact**: Establishes mandatory agent compliance standards

This plan directly addresses the pattern we identified: AI agents using non-functional commands (echo) when functional
actions (actual tests) are required, ensuring constitutional traceability and intent alignment.
