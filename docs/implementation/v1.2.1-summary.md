## Overview
This document tracks the implementation and completion of the ML-driven blueprint auto-repair engine for Aegis Framework v1.2.1.

## Current Status
- Core engine scaffolded and integrated
- Rule-based pattern recognition and repair logic implemented
- Observability event emission to `framework/observability/events.jsonl` complete
- All tests passing

## Remaining Steps

### 1. Expand Pattern Recognition & Repair Logic
- [ ] Add more rules for common blueprint errors (missing fields, invalid types, contract violations)
- [ ] Implement context-sensitive repair strategies
- [ ] (Optional) Add plugin/adapter interface for ML model integration

### 2. Observability & Telemetry Enhancements
- [ ] Enrich event context (blueprint ID, user/session info, operation context)
- [ ] Add error handling for event emission
- [ ] Ensure all repair attempts are logged

### 3. Documentation & Examples
- [ ] Update `docs/implementation/auto-repair-ml-engine.md` with new patterns and usage
- [ ] Add developer guidance for extending the engine

### 4. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Add/expand tests for new patterns and repairs
- [ ] Validate event emission and traceability
- [ ] Review for constitutional compliance and auditability

## Completion Criteria
- All planned patterns and repairs implemented
- Observability events are comprehensive and robust
- Documentation and tests are up to date
- All constitutional and blueprint contract requirements are met
