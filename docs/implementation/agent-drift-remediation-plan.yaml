  # Constitutional annotations
  aegisFrameworkVersion: "2.0.0-alpha-dev"
  blueprintId: "constitutional-governance"
  mode: "strict"
  intent: "Prevent AI agent drift from constitutional principles through technical and procedural safeguards"
  context: "Response to identified agent drift pattern where echo commands were used instead of functional tests"

targetProject:
  path: "/Users/nino/Workspace/02-local-dev/aegis-framework"
  type: "aegis-framework-core"
  currentFrameworkVersion: "2.0.0-alpha-dev"
  detectedIssues:
    - "AI agents can drift from stated intent without detection"
    - "Echo commands used for functional testing violate constitutional principles"
    - "No real-time enforcement of constitutional compliance"
    - "Lack of intent alignment validation before command execution"
    - "Missing constitutional agent wrapper classes"
