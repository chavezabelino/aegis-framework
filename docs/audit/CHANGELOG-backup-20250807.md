## [1.7.0] - 2025-08-06

### Enhanced

- __Merged v2.5 battle-tested operational patterns__: Integrated proven Kilo + bracket-app-audit standards from v2.5
  into Aegis Constitutional framework
- __Execution mode decision matrix__: Added guidance for when to use Constitutional (`strict`), tactical (`lean`), or
  hybrid approaches
- __Enhanced operational discipline__: Strengthened "compiler for intent" agent behavior patterns and execution
  validation
- __Improved RCA integration__: Token-gated analysis now includes Constitutional compliance and Blueprint impact
  assessment
- __Expanded pitfall detection__: Added impact levels and emergency patterns for critical production scenarios

### Added

- __Hybrid execution mode__: Combines Constitutional annotations with operational patterns (recommended default)
- __Pattern selection guide__: Code examples for enterprise, tactical, and hybrid approaches
- __Enhanced pre-commit checklist__: More specific validation requirements with Constitutional and operational
  compliance
- __Emergency fix patterns__: Critical production fix templates with required annotations

### Design Philosophy

- __Constitutional + Operational__: Best of both systematic governance AND battle-tested execution discipline
- __Context-appropriate scaling__: Enterprise governance when needed, tactical speed when possible
- __Proven pattern integration__: v2.5 operational patterns enhanced with Constitutional traceability
- __Decision framework__: Clear guidance on when to use which approach based on project context

### Migration Notes

- Existing `strict` mode unchanged for full Constitutional compliance
- New `lean` mode emphasizes operational patterns with minimal Constitutional overhead
- `hybrid` mode (new default) provides balanced approach for most use cases
- All modes maintain core Constitutional requirements (annotations, traceability)

---

### Fixed

- __Eliminated redundant instruction files__: Removed duplicate `copilot-kilo-standards.md` which contained identical
  content to `GitHub-copilot-ready.md`
- __Single source of truth__: `framework/generated/instructions/current/GitHub-copilot-ready.md` now serves as the
  complete, merged instruction set
- __Removed over-engineering__: Deleted redundant `generate-copilot-kilo-standards.cjs` CLI tool that was creating
  unnecessary duplication

### Clarified

- __File purpose__: The layered approach (framework + project standards) in a single file is the correct architecture
- __Content completeness__: Single file contains all Constitutional compliance AND operational patterns - no separate
  "merged" version needed

---

## [1.5.0] - 2025-08-06

### Added

- __Composable, layered agent instructions__: Framework now generates ready-to-use, IDE/agent-specific instructions by
  merging Constitutional (framework) and project-specific (operational) guidance into a single output file.
- __Project profile and standards support__: CLI and template system accept a `project-profile.YAML` and/or Markdown
  template (e.g., `/templates/project-standards.md`) to inject project-specific workflows, directory conventions, and
  code patterns.
- __Unified output__: Generates `/generated/instructions/{agent}-ready.md` with both compliance and actionable project
  guidance for the target IDE/agent.

### Design

- __Layered Generation__: Instruction output is composed of:
  1. Framework/Constitutional section (auto-generated, versioned)
  2. Project-specific operational standards (from project profile/template)
  3. Agent/IDE-specific integration tips
- __Automation__: CLI tool accepts both agent and project profile, merges both layers, and renders a single Markdown
  file.
- __Extensible__: Supports per-IDE or per-agent customization and future project standards.

### Migration

- No breaking changes. Existing instruction generation remains supported; new composable output is additive and opt-in.

### Usage Instructions

- Add or edit your project profile in `project-profile.YAML` and/or `/templates/project-standards.md`.
- Run: `node CLI/generate-agent-instructions-v2.cjs GitHub-copilot --project-profile project-profile.YAML`
- Find the merged output in `/generated/instructions/GitHub-copilot-ready.md`.

---

## [1.4.0] - 2025-08-06

### Added

### Changed

- Instruction generation now leverages framework docs and agent profiles
- All new instructions are assembled from templates and live documentation

### Migration

- No breaking changes. Existing instructions are archived; new system is backward compatible.

### Usage Instructions

- To generate agent instructions using the new system:

  2. Run the CLI tool: `node CLI/generate-agent-instructions-v2.cjs`
  3. Generated instructions will appear in `framework/generated/instructions/` with metadata and archive support.
- For custom agent profiles or instruction sections, add or modify YAML files in `framework/templates/agent-profiles/`
  and reference them in the CLI.
- For more details, see the README or run the CLI with `--help` for options and advanced usage.

---

- To audit an existing application and generate a migration plan:
  1. Run: `node CLI/Aegis-migration-audit.cjs <target-path> [options]`
  2. Options:
     - `--output <file>` Write migration plan to file (default: stdout)
     - `--strict` Fail on first critical compliance issue
     - `--help` Show usage instructions
  3. Example: `node CLI/Aegis-migration-audit.cjs ../my-app --output migration-plan.md --strict`
  4. The tool will scan for Blueprints, contracts, and Constitutional files, and output actionable migration steps.
