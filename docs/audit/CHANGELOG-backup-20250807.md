  - Added `ai-agent-mode.template.md` for execution discipline and intent compilation
  - Added `directory-structure.template.md` for structural integrity enforcement
  - Added `rca-debug-loop.template.md` for token-gated AI analysis integration

  - **Impact**: Framework now generates instructions that include v2.5 operational patterns without manual editing

## [1.7.0] - 2025-08-06
### Enhanced
- **Merged v2.5 battle-tested operational patterns**: Integrated proven Kilo + bracket-app-audit standards from v2.5 into Aegis constitutional framework
- **Execution mode decision matrix**: Added guidance for when to use constitutional (`strict`), tactical (`lean`), or hybrid approaches
- **Enhanced operational discipline**: Strengthened "compiler for intent" agent behavior patterns and execution validation
- **Improved RCA integration**: Token-gated analysis now includes constitutional compliance and blueprint impact assessment
- **Expanded pitfall detection**: Added impact levels and emergency patterns for critical production scenarios

### Added
- **Hybrid execution mode**: Combines constitutional annotations with operational patterns (recommended default)
- **Pattern selection guide**: Code examples for enterprise, tactical, and hybrid approaches
- **Enhanced pre-commit checklist**: More specific validation requirements with constitutional and operational compliance
- **Emergency fix patterns**: Critical production fix templates with required annotations

### Design Philosophy
- **Constitutional + Operational**: Best of both systematic governance AND battle-tested execution discipline  
- **Context-appropriate scaling**: Enterprise governance when needed, tactical speed when possible
- **Proven pattern integration**: v2.5 operational patterns enhanced with constitutional traceability
- **Decision framework**: Clear guidance on when to use which approach based on project context

### Migration Notes
- Existing `strict` mode unchanged for full constitutional compliance
- New `lean` mode emphasizes operational patterns with minimal constitutional overhead
- `hybrid` mode (new default) provides balanced approach for most use cases
- All modes maintain core constitutional requirements (annotations, traceability)

---
### Fixed
- **Eliminated redundant instruction files**: Removed duplicate `copilot-kilo-standards.md` which contained identical content to `github-copilot-ready.md`
- **Single source of truth**: `framework/generated/instructions/current/github-copilot-ready.md` now serves as the complete, merged instruction set
- **Removed over-engineering**: Deleted redundant `generate-copilot-kilo-standards.cjs` CLI tool that was creating unnecessary duplication

### Clarified
- **File purpose**: The layered approach (framework + project standards) in a single file is the correct architecture
- **Content completeness**: Single file contains all constitutional compliance AND operational patterns - no separate "merged" version needed

---

## [1.5.0] - 2025-08-06
### Added
- **Composable, layered agent instructions**: Framework now generates ready-to-use, IDE/agent-specific instructions by merging constitutional (framework) and project-specific (operational) guidance into a single output file.
- **Project profile and standards support**: CLI and template system accept a `project-profile.yaml` and/or markdown template (e.g., `/templates/project-standards.md`) to inject project-specific workflows, directory conventions, and code patterns.
- **Unified output**: Generates `/generated/instructions/{agent}-ready.md` with both compliance and actionable project guidance for the target IDE/agent.

### Design
- **Layered Generation**: Instruction output is composed of:
  1. Framework/constitutional section (auto-generated, versioned)
  2. Project-specific operational standards (from project profile/template)
  3. Agent/IDE-specific integration tips
- **Automation**: CLI tool accepts both agent and project profile, merges both layers, and renders a single markdown file.
- **Extensible**: Supports per-IDE or per-agent customization and future project standards.

### Migration
- No breaking changes. Existing instruction generation remains supported; new composable output is additive and opt-in.

### Usage Instructions
- Add or edit your project profile in `project-profile.yaml` and/or `/templates/project-standards.md`.
- Run: `node cli/generate-agent-instructions-v2.cjs github-copilot --project-profile project-profile.yaml`
- Find the merged output in `/generated/instructions/github-copilot-ready.md`.

---

## [1.4.0] - 2025-08-06
### Added
- Template-driven, agent-agnostic instruction generation system
- Modular instruction templates and agent profiles in `framework/templates/`
- Organized output structure in `framework/generated/instructions/`
- Generation metadata and archive support for traceability
- **Migration audit CLI tool**: `cli/aegis-migration-audit.cjs` for scanning applications and generating migration plans

### Changed
- Instruction generation now leverages framework docs and agent profiles
- All new instructions are assembled from templates and live documentation

### Migration
- No breaking changes. Existing instructions are archived; new system is backward compatible.

### Usage Instructions
- To generate agent instructions using the new system:
  1. Edit or add modular templates and agent profiles in `framework/templates/` as needed.
  2. Run the CLI tool: `node cli/generate-agent-instructions-v2.cjs`
  3. Generated instructions will appear in `framework/generated/instructions/` with metadata and archive support.
- For custom agent profiles or instruction sections, add or modify YAML files in `framework/templates/agent-profiles/` and reference them in the CLI.
- For more details, see the README or run the CLI with `--help` for options and advanced usage.

---

- To audit an existing application and generate a migration plan:
  1. Run: `node cli/aegis-migration-audit.cjs <target-path> [options]`
  2. Options:
     - `--output <file>`   Write migration plan to file (default: stdout)
     - `--strict`          Fail on first critical compliance issue
     - `--help`            Show usage instructions
  3. Example: `node cli/aegis-migration-audit.cjs ../my-app --output migration-plan.md --strict`
  4. The tool will scan for blueprints, contracts, and constitutional files, and output actionable migration steps.

### Future Enhancements
