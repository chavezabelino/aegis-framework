## How to Use This Roadmap

- Update status markers as work progresses (`not started`, `in progress`, `complete`).
- Reference this roadmap in changelog and release notes.
- Use for team planning, prioritization, and progress tracking.
- Link implementation PRs/issues to roadmap items for traceability.

## Automation & Efficiency Recommendations

## Documentation Organization Strategy (v1.3.0)

- Move phase/option implementation docs to `docs/implementation/`.
- Use consistent naming: `phase-1-implementation.md`, `option-b-implementation.md`, etc.
- Keep only high-level core docs in the root (e.g., `README.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- Reference implementation docs from roadmap and changelog for traceability.
- Automate future doc placement and reference updates via scripts.

---

## Completed Features (v1.4.0)

- Status: âœ… completed
- Enhanced Template Quality & GitHub Copilot Instructions:
  - Fixed HTML entity generation in templates (100% encoding compliance)
  - Comprehensive GitHub Copilot instructions with Constitutional compliance
  - Multi-agent orchestration and apprenticeship integration
  - Production-ready template generation system

## Planned Features (v1.5.0-v1.7.0)

- Status: not started

### Team Customization Support (v1.5.0-v1.7.0)

- Enhanced CLI with granular customization flags
- Validation integration for custom sections
- Support for `.Aegis-customization.YAML` configuration

#### __v1.6.0 - Append & Merge Modes**

- Custom section append capability (add team-specific content)
- Multiple merge strategies (`selective`, `append`, `hybrid`)
- Template inheritance and extension system
- Enhanced validation for custom content

#### __v1.7.0 - Advanced Customization**

- Conditional section rendering based on team profiles
- Visual diff for customized vs. framework instructions
- Team collaboration features for shared customizations
- Enterprise-grade override management

### Apprenticeship Scaffolds (v1.8.0)

- Blueprint reflection blocks and prompts
- Observability events for learning signals
- Ghost Mentor plugin system for review/feedback
- Reflection-aware hybrid snapshots for learning delta
- CLI and schema support for apprenticeship workflows

## Future Vision: Framework Observability Platform

### Canonical Event Logging Infrastructure

**Vision__: Transform current file-based drift logging into a sophisticated, database-backed observability platform
similar to modern log aggregation systems.

**Core Concept__: Drift events should be treated as first-class citizens in the framework ecosystem - logged, indexed,
searchable, and analyzable just like traditional application logs (info, warn, error, debug levels).

#### __Proposed Event Taxonomy**

```typescript
enum DriftEventLevel {
  TRACE = "trace", // Fine-grained tracking for debugging
  DEBUG = "debug", // Detailed diagnostic information
  INFO = "info", // General framework operation events
  WARN = "warn", // Potential issues that don't break functionality
  ERROR = "error", // Violations requiring immediate attention
  FATAL = "fatal", // Critical Constitutional violations
  METRIC = "metric" // Performance and health metrics
}

interface CanonicalDriftEvent {
  timestamp: string
  level: DriftEventLevel
  eventType: string
  agentId: string
  blueprintId?: string
  correlationId: string
  sessionId: string
  userId?: string
  projectId?: string
  metadata: Record<string, any>
  stackTrace?: string
  performance?: PerformanceMetrics
  Constitutional?: ConstitutionalContext
}
```text

#### __Database-Backed Architecture**

- __Event Store__: Time-series database for high-volume event ingestion
- __Analytics Engine__: Real-time and batch processing for insights
- __Alerting System__: Constitutional violation detection and escalation
- __Dashboard Platform__: Visual analytics and trend analysis
- __API Layer__: Query interface for framework tools and external systems

#### __Advanced Analytics & Feedback Loops**

- __Pattern Recognition__: ML-powered detection of drift patterns before they become violations
- __Performance Correlation__: Link framework performance to Constitutional compliance metrics
- __Predictive Insights__: Forecast potential Constitutional violations based on historical patterns
- __Automated Remediation__: Self-healing framework responses to detected drift
- __Framework Evolution__: Data-driven Constitutional amendments and improvements

#### __Integration Points**

- __IDE Extensions__: Real-time drift alerts in development environment
- __CI/CD Pipeline__: Automated drift prevention and reporting
- __Framework Tools__: Enhanced CLI with analytics-driven insights
- __Multi-Agent Coordination__: Shared observability across agent ecosystems
- __Constitutional Conductor__: Analytics-informed governance automation

#### __Reporting & Dashboards**

- __Framework Health Scorecards__: Real-time Constitutional compliance metrics
- __Drift Trend Analysis__: Historical patterns and prevention effectiveness
- __Agent Performance Analytics__: Individual and collective agent behavior insights
- __Blueprint Lifecycle Tracking__: End-to-end observability for Blueprint-driven development
- __Constitutional Evolution Metrics__: Track amendment effectiveness and framework adaptation

#### __Privacy & Security Considerations**

- __Data Anonymization__: Protect sensitive project and user information
- __Consent Management__: Opt-in observability with granular control
- __Retention Policies__: Configurable data lifecycle management
- __Access Controls__: Role-based access to analytics and insights
- __Compliance__: GDPR, SOC2, and enterprise security requirements

**Impact__: This platform would transform the Aegis Framework from a governance system into a self-improving,
data-driven AI engineering ecosystem that learns from every interaction and continuously evolves its Constitutional
enforcement mechanisms.

**Timeline__: Future vision item - not tied to specific version, requires foundational database infrastructure and
analytics platform development.
