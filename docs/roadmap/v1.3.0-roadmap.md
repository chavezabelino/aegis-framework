<!--
@aegisFrameworkVersion: 1.3.0-planning
@intent: Roadmap for next release and long-term vision
-->

## Release Status
- v1.2.0-alpha: complete
- v1.3.0: not started
- v2.0.0: planned

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Immediate Next Steps (v1.3.0)

### 1. Enhance Blueprint Auto-Repair Algorithms
- Status: not started
- Improve the self-healing engine with more advanced ML-driven repair logic.
- Add support for more blueprint schema edge cases and error types.

### 2. Real-Time Observability Dashboard
- Status: not started
- Build a web-based dashboard for live metrics, health scores, and alerts.
- Integrate with the advanced observability engine for visualization.

### 3. Machine Learning for Pattern Prediction
- Status: not started
- Train models on drift logs and blueprint histories to predict future issues.
- Use these predictions for proactive healing and governance recommendations.

### 4. External Monitoring & CI/CD Integration
- Status: not started
- Connect observability and healing systems to external tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Datadog).
- Automate health checks and healing in CI/CD pipelines.

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Next Version Features (v1.3.0)
- Status: not started
- Predictive Failure Detection & Prevention: Automated detection and mitigation of system risks.
- Performance Optimization Engine: Automatic tuning of framework and blueprint performance.
- Cross-Framework API Integration: Import and adapt APIs/patterns from other frameworks.
- Community Pattern Marketplace: Enable users to contribute, validate, and share patterns.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Planned Automation & Efficiency Enhancements (v1.3.0)
- Status: not started
- Scripted roadmap/changelog sync: Auto-move completed items from roadmap to changelog.
- CI/CD and project board integration: Live tracking of roadmap status.
- Automated release tagging and version bumping after roadmap completion.
- Standardized blueprint/feature templates for new work.
- Observability event emission for roadmap progress.
- Auto-generation of amendment proposals for major roadmap changes.

---

## ðŸŸ£ Long-Term Vision (v2.0.0+)
- Status: planned
- Fully Autonomous Framework Evolution: Minimal human oversight, self-modifying governance.
- AI-Driven Architectural Recommendations: Automated design and optimization suggestions.
- Global Intelligence Network: Share and learn patterns across frameworks worldwide.
- Adaptive Constitutional Governance: Dynamic amendment and rule evolution.

---

## How to Use This Roadmap
- Update status markers as work progresses (`not started`, `in progress`, `complete`).
- Reference this roadmap in changelog and release notes.
- Use for team planning, prioritization, and progress tracking.
- Link implementation PRs/issues to roadmap items for traceability.

## Automation & Efficiency Recommendations

## Documentation Organization Strategy (v1.3.0)
- Move phase/option implementation docs to `docs/implementation/`.
- Use consistent naming: `phase-1-implementation.md`, `option-b-implementation.md`, etc.
- Keep only high-level core docs in the root (e.g., `README.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- Reference implementation docs from roadmap and changelog for traceability.
- Automate future doc placement and reference updates via scripts.

---

## Planned Features (v1.4.0)
- Status: not started
- Apprenticeship Scaffolds for Junior Developers:
  - `@apprenticeshipMode` execution contexts (guided, challenge, review-only)
  - Blueprint reflection blocks and prompts
  - Observability events for learning signals
  - Ghost Mentor plugin system for review/feedback
  - Reflection-aware hybrid snapshots for learning delta
  - CLI and schema support for apprenticeship workflows

---

This roadmap is the canonical source for next release planning. Update regularly and automate wherever possible for maximum efficiency.
