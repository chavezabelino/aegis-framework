## How to Use This Roadmap
- Update status markers as work progresses (`not started`, `in progress`, `complete`).
- Reference this roadmap in changelog and release notes.
- Use for team planning, prioritization, and progress tracking.
- Link implementation PRs/issues to roadmap items for traceability.

## Automation & Efficiency Recommendations

## Documentation Organization Strategy (v1.3.0)
- Move phase/option implementation docs to `docs/implementation/`.
- Use consistent naming: `phase-1-implementation.md`, `option-b-implementation.md`, etc.
- Keep only high-level core docs in the root (e.g., `README.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- Reference implementation docs from roadmap and changelog for traceability.
- Automate future doc placement and reference updates via scripts.

---

## Completed Features (v1.4.0)
- Status: âœ… completed
- Enhanced Template Quality & GitHub Copilot Instructions:
  - Fixed HTML entity generation in templates (100% encoding compliance)
  - Comprehensive GitHub Copilot instructions with constitutional compliance
  - Multi-agent orchestration and apprenticeship integration
  - Production-ready template generation system

## Planned Features (v1.5.0-v1.7.0)
- Status: not started

### Team Customization Support (v1.5.0-v1.7.0)
**Priority**: High - Critical for framework adoption
**Design**: See [Customization Enhancement Plan](../implementation/customization-enhancement-plan.md)

- Enhanced CLI with granular customization flags
- Validation integration for custom sections
- Support for `.aegis-customization.yaml` configuration

#### **v1.6.0 - Append & Merge Modes** 
- Custom section append capability (add team-specific content)
- Multiple merge strategies (`selective`, `append`, `hybrid`)
- Template inheritance and extension system
- Enhanced validation for custom content

#### **v1.7.0 - Advanced Customization**
- Conditional section rendering based on team profiles
- Visual diff for customized vs. framework instructions
- Team collaboration features for shared customizations
- Enterprise-grade override management

### Apprenticeship Scaffolds (v1.8.0)

## Future Vision: Framework Observability Platform

### Canonical Event Logging Infrastructure
**Vision**: Transform current file-based drift logging into a sophisticated, database-backed observability platform similar to modern log aggregation systems.

**Core Concept**: Drift events should be treated as first-class citizens in the framework ecosystem - logged, indexed, searchable, and analyzable just like traditional application logs (info, warn, error, debug levels).

#### **Proposed Event Taxonomy**
```typescript
enum DriftEventLevel {
  TRACE = 'trace',     // Fine-grained tracking for debugging
  DEBUG = 'debug',     // Detailed diagnostic information
  INFO = 'info',       // General framework operation events
  WARN = 'warn',       // Potential issues that don't break functionality
  ERROR = 'error',     // Violations requiring immediate attention
  FATAL = 'fatal',     // Critical constitutional violations
  METRIC = 'metric'    // Performance and health metrics
}

interface CanonicalDriftEvent {
  timestamp: string;
  level: DriftEventLevel;
  eventType: string;
  agentId: string;
  blueprintId?: string;
  correlationId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  userId?: string;
  projectId?: string;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  stackTrace?: string;
  performance?: PerformanceMetrics;
  constitutional?: ConstitutionalContext;
}
```

#### **Database-Backed Architecture**
- **Event Store**: Time-series database for high-volume event ingestion
- **Analytics Engine**: Real-time and batch processing for insights
- **Alerting System**: Constitutional violation detection and escalation
- **Dashboard Platform**: Visual analytics and trend analysis
- **API Layer**: Query interface for framework tools and external systems

#### **Advanced Analytics & Feedback Loops**
- **Pattern Recognition**: ML-powered detection of drift patterns before they become violations
- **Performance Correlation**: Link framework performance to constitutional compliance metrics
- **Predictive Insights**: Forecast potential constitutional violations based on historical patterns
- **Automated Remediation**: Self-healing framework responses to detected drift
- **Framework Evolution**: Data-driven constitutional amendments and improvements

#### **Integration Points**
- **IDE Extensions**: Real-time drift alerts in development environment
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated drift prevention and reporting
- **Framework Tools**: Enhanced CLI with analytics-driven insights
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Shared observability across agent ecosystems
- **Constitutional Conductor**: Analytics-informed governance automation

#### **Reporting & Dashboards**
- **Framework Health Scorecards**: Real-time constitutional compliance metrics
- **Drift Trend Analysis**: Historical patterns and prevention effectiveness
- **Agent Performance Analytics**: Individual and collective agent behavior insights
- **Blueprint Lifecycle Tracking**: End-to-end observability for blueprint-driven development
- **Constitutional Evolution Metrics**: Track amendment effectiveness and framework adaptation

#### **Privacy & Security Considerations**
- **Data Anonymization**: Protect sensitive project and user information
- **Consent Management**: Opt-in observability with granular control
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable data lifecycle management
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access to analytics and insights
- **Compliance**: GDPR, SOC2, and enterprise security requirements

**Impact**: This platform would transform the Aegis Framework from a governance system into a self-improving, data-driven AI engineering ecosystem that learns from every interaction and continuously evolves its constitutional enforcement mechanisms.

**Timeline**: Future vision item - not tied to specific version, requires foundational database infrastructure and analytics platform development.
