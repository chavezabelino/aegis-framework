## üéØ Executive Summary

**Critical Gap Identified**: The Aegis Framework lacks authentication blueprints, forcing developers into constitutional violations during authentication implementation. This remediation plan creates a comprehensive authentication blueprint suite to eliminate this foundational gap.

**Constitutional Violation**: Field usage revealed systematic blueprint bypassing due to missing authentication patterns, violating Article I (Blueprint Primacy) and Article III (Mandatory Annotations).

**Strategic Impact**: Authentication is fundamental to most applications. This gap represents a critical framework limitation that undermines constitutional governance principles.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### **Primary Cause**
Framework development prioritized feature blueprints (chat, data-tables, public viewing) while neglecting foundational authentication patterns.

### **Contributing Factors**
1. **Assumption Bias**: Authentication assumed to be "basic" and not requiring blueprint governance
2. **Development Prioritization**: Feature-first approach neglected infrastructure patterns
3. **Constitutional Enforcement Gap**: No preventive mechanisms for non-blueprint code generation
4. **Field Testing Gap**: Insufficient real-world usage testing revealed this gap late

### **Systemic Implications**
- Other foundational patterns (routing, validation, error handling) may have similar gaps
- Framework credibility risk from constitutional violations
- Developer experience degradation due to manual fixes

## üìä Implementation Plan

### **Step 1: Core Authentication Blueprint**
```yaml
blueprint: "lucia-auth-basic"
description: "Fundamental Lucia v3 authentication patterns"

components:
  registration:
    - User input validation
    - Password hashing (Argon2)
    - Database user creation
    - Session establishment
    - Error handling patterns
    
  login:
    - Credential validation
    - Password verification
    - Session management
    - Security event logging
    - Fallback UX patterns
    
  logout:
    - Session invalidation
    - Security cleanup
    - Redirect handling
    - Audit trail creation

observability:
  events:
    - "auth.registration.attempted"
    - "auth.registration.successful"
    - "auth.login.attempted"
    - "auth.login.successful"
    - "auth.logout.initiated"
    - "auth.session.expired"
    - "auth.security.violation"

errorStates:
  - code: "INVALID_CREDENTIALS"
    fallback: "Show generic error message"
    recovery: "Rate limit and log attempt"
  - code: "SESSION_EXPIRED"
    fallback: "Redirect to login with context"
    recovery: "Preserve user workflow state"
  - code: "DATABASE_ERROR"
    fallback: "Show maintenance message"
    recovery: "Queue operation for retry"

securityRules:
  - "Password minimum 8 characters"
  - "Rate limiting on authentication attempts"
  - "Secure session cookie configuration"
  - "CSRF protection on all forms"
  - "Input sanitization and validation"
```

### **Step 2: Database Integration Blueprint**
```yaml
blueprint: "database-auth-integration"
description: "Drizzle ORM authentication database patterns"

components:
  schema:
    - User table definition
    - Session table definition
    - Index optimization
    - Migration scripts
    
  queries:
    - Standard Drizzle syntax patterns
    - Transaction handling
    - Connection management
    - Error handling

constitutionalCompliance:
  - No experimental API usage
  - Validated query patterns only
  - Observable database operations
  - Error state definitions
```

### **Step 3: Constitutional Validation Rules**
```yaml
validationRules:
  authentication:
    - "All auth code must reference blueprint ID"
    - "Mandatory observability events required"
    - "Security fallback states defined"
    - "Error handling patterns implemented"
    
  security:
    - "Password hashing validated"
    - "Session security verified"
    - "CSRF protection confirmed"
    - "Rate limiting implemented"
    
  observability:
    - "Authentication events logged"
    - "Security violations tracked"
    - "Performance metrics captured"
    - "Error states monitored"
```

## üîí Security Requirements

### **Authentication Security Standards**
- **Password Security**: Argon2 hashing with salt
- **Session Management**: Secure, HTTP-only cookies
