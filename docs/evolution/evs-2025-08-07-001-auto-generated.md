## üîç Automatic Detection

### **Trigger Type**

Constitutional-violation

### **Severity Level**

critical

### **Evidence Found**

- Staged Constitutional file without evolution story: CONSTITUTION.md

## üå± Field Context

### **Detection Pattern**

potential gap or insight that should be documented.

### **Investigation Required**

**Human review needed** to complete this evolution story with:

- Actual field context and user workflow
- Root cause analysis
- Proposed solutions
- Implementation strategy

## üöß Action Required

This is an **automatically generated placeholder** that requires human investigation and completion.

### **Next Steps**

1. Review the detected evidence
2. Investigate the underlying cause
