# 🛠️ Version & Roadmap Remediation Plan

**Plan Version__: 1.0  
**Implementation Date__: August 7, 2025  
**Framework Version__: v2.1.0  
**Constitutional Authority__: Article II (Framework Governance) & Article VII (Amendment Process)

---

## 📋 __Executive Summary**

This remediation plan addresses critical version drift and roadmap inconsistencies identified in the comprehensive
audit. Implementation follows Constitutional requirements for systematic framework evolution and establishes sustainable
version management practices.

---

## 🎯 __Phase 1: Version Truth Reconciliation (24 Hours)**

### __1.1 CHANGELOG Cleanup & Reconciliation**

#### __Issue Identified**

- Phantom version entries (v1.5.0, v1.7.x) without corresponding git tags
- Duplicated v1.4.0 entries causing confusion
- Chronological ordering issues

#### __Remediation Actions**

```bash
# Validate current CHANGELOG against git tags
git tag | grep -E "v[12]\." | sort -V > actual-versions.txt

# Create cleaned CHANGELOG based on actual releases
node tools/reconcile-changelog.ts --validate-against-git
```

#### __Success Criteria**

- ✅ CHANGELOG entries match git tag history 100%
- ✅ No phantom or undocumented versions remain
- ✅ Chronological order matches actual release dates
- ✅ Constitutional annotations present on all entries

### __1.2 Missing Release Documentation Creation**

#### __Priority Releases Needing Documentation**

1. __v2.1.0__ (current version - critical gap!)
2. __v1.2.0-alpha__ (missing summary)
3. __v1.2.1__ (missing summary)

#### __Implementation**

- Create `docs/releases/v2.1.0-summary.md` using release template
- Backfill v1.2.x summaries based on git commit history
- Update release index to reflect true current version

### __1.3 README & Roadmap Alignment**

#### __Updates Required**

- README roadmap section: Update v2.0.0 → v2.1.0 as current
- Roadmap timelines: Adjust based on actual delivery vs planned
- Remove references to undelivered features marked as "complete"

---

## 🗺️ __Phase 2: Capability-Based Roadmap Standardization (Week 1)**

### __2.1 New Roadmap Structure Implementation**

#### __Current Problem**

Version-driven roadmaps become obsolete when development diverges from planning.

#### __Solution: Capability-Driven Organization**

```
docs/roadmap/
├── README.md                      # Master roadmap index & navigation
├── current-state.md              # What we have delivered (v2.1.0)
├── immediate-horizon.md          # Next 3 months (high confidence)
├── planning-horizon.md           # 3-6 months (medium confidence)
├── strategic-vision.md           # 6+ months (directional)
└── capabilities/                 # Feature-specific detailed plans
    ├── configurability-system.md
    ├── tech-stack-neutrality.md
    ├── governance-automation.md
    └── enterprise-integration.md
```

#### __Benefits**

- __Resilient to Development Changes__: Capabilities vs version-locked features
- __Clear Confidence Levels__: Time horizons indicate planning certainty
- __Maintainable__: Updates based on capability delivery, not arbitrary dates

### __2.2 Current State Documentation**

#### __Comprehensive "What We Have Today" Summary**

Create definitive inventory of delivered capabilities as of v2.1.0:

- ✅ Constitutional governance framework
- ✅ One-command hydration (`Aegis hydrate`)
- ✅ Package distribution (npm + Docker)
- ✅ Template quality enforcement
- ✅ Evolution story detection
- ✅ Multi-agent orchestration foundation

### __2.3 Release Planning Integration**

#### __Roadmap → Release Process**

- Capability readiness drives version planning
- Feature graduation criteria (experimental → beta → stable)
- Release train coordination with capability milestones

---

## 🔄 __Phase 3: Drift Prevention Framework (Week 2)**

### __3.1 Automated Version Consistency**

#### __Constitutional Tooling Implementation**

```typescript
// tools/validate-version-consistency.ts
interface VersionValidation {
  versionFile: string // VERSION file
  gitTags: string[] // Actual git tags
  changelogEntries: string[] // CHANGELOG versions
  roadmapReferences: string[] // Roadmap version refs
  releaseDocuments: string[] // docs/releases/ coverage
}
```

#### __CI/CD Integration**

```yaml
# .GitHub/workflows/Constitutional-compliance.yml
- name: Version Consistency Check
  run: |
    npm run validate:versions
    npm run validate:roadmap-alignment
    npm run validate:release-coverage
```

### __3.2 Constitutional Compliance Automation**

#### __Required Validations**

- __Article II Compliance__: Semantic versioning enforcement
- __Release Documentation__: Complete coverage requirement
- __Roadmap Consistency__: Capability delivery tracking
- __Amendment Process__: Version changes follow Constitutional review

### __3.3 Framework Evolution Documentation**

#### __Evolution Story Integration**

This remediation triggers __Evolution Story EVS-2025-08-07-002__:

- __Title__: "Version Management Systematic Gap"
- __Trigger__: Field usage exposed governance framework limitations
- __Learning__: Need for automated consistency validation
- __Framework Enhancement__: Constitutional version management tooling
