ðŸ“„ Aegis Framework Explainer â€” Engineering Team

Why You Should Care

You're using AI to build software. That changes the rules. Traditional tooling (git, lint, CI) assumes humans are writing code. Aegis assumes agents are writing it too â€” and gives you the control surface to make it safe.

What Aegis Adds

Blueprint-driven development: Every feature has an intent contract

Agent accountability: You know who generated what and why

Replayable changes: Every agent output can be diffed, tested, and regenerated

Validation at CI: Drift detection, schema checks, intent enforcement

Execution modes: lean, strict, generative for cost/control tradeoffs

Self-healing governance: Framework monitors its own constitutional compliance

What You Get

Build safely with Copilot, Kilo, Lovable, or others

Track agent behavior across features

Log when agents "forget" prior instructions

Enforce rules with a single CLI (aegis-conductor)

Constitutional compliance: Automated enforcement of framework standards

Zero-maintenance governance: System maintains itself and prevents drift

## ðŸ”® Self-Healing Governance (Coming in v2.3.0-alpha)

**Constitutional enforcement**: Framework monitors its own compliance automatically

**Automated drift detection**: Catches violations before they spread through the codebase  

**Democratic evolution**: Community-driven constitutional amendments and governance

**Zero-maintenance governance**: System maintains itself without manual oversight

**Safe auto-correction**: Fixes common violations (annotations, versioning) automatically

**Complete audit trail**: Every constitutional action logged and reversible

This isn't more process. It's a system that makes agent-assisted development safe and repeatable â€” and now it governs itself.
