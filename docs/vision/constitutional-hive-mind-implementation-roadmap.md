## 🎯 **Vision → Reality: No-BS Implementation Path**

Transform the Constitutional Hive Mind from "poetic vision" to a running system using:

- **Append-only learning ledger** in Postgres for control plane
- **Optional event streaming** when scale/latency demand it
- **OLAP** for pattern mining and intelligence
- **Cheap object store** for bulky evidence payloads

**Start simple, upgrade when the data shape proves it.**

---

## 🏗️ **System Architecture Decision**

### **Phase 0 (Proof/MVP):** Boring & Reliable

- **No broker** - HTTP ingest → Neon Postgres (control-plane)
- **S3-compatible object store** for large artifacts
- **Daily batch jobs** for pattern mining
- **Cheap, reliable, auditable**

### **Phase 1 (Scale/Real-time):** Smart Upgrade

- **NATS JetStream** or **Redpanda** for streaming
- **Postgres as system of record** (ledger + registry)
- **ClickHouse OLAP** for pattern mining
- **Constitutional DNA** published as versioned package

### **Always:** Constitutional Governance

- **Versioned Constitutional DNA** published as package/manifest
- **Consensus tracking** on-ledger
- **All changes PR'd** to repo for human review

---

## 📦 **Core System Components**

### **1. Node SDK (Client Side)**

**Purpose**: Collect signals (violations, gaps, friction), anonymize, sign, and ship.

```
// packages/Aegis-node-sdk/src/types.ts
export type NodeId = `node_${string}`
export type DnaVersion = `dna_${string}`

export interface ViolationSignal {
  kind: "violation"
  nodeId: NodeId
  dna: DnaVersion
  blueprintId: string
  rule: string
  severity: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical"
  context: Record<string, unknown> // redacted
  occurredAt: string // ISO
}

export interface GapSignal {
  kind: "gap"
  nodeId: NodeId
  dna: DnaVersion
  blueprintId: string
  description: string // human text, locally stripped of PII
  evidenceRef?: string // S3 key
  occurredAt: string
}

export interface FrictionSignal {
  kind: "friction"
  nodeId: NodeId
  dna: DnaVersion
  step: string // where in the flow
  cost: number // time or points
  tags?: string[]
  occurredAt: string
}

export type LearningSignal = ViolationSignal | GapSignal | FrictionSignal
```

**Key Behaviors:**

- **Offline buffer** → retry with exponential backoff
- **Anonymization**: salted hash for user/project IDs; redact PII; DP noise for counts
- **Schema**: compile-time TS types + Zod runtime validation; send only whitelisted fields
- **Transport**: HTTP POST (MVP). Later: publish to NATS/Redpanda with protobuf

### **2. Ingestion Gateway (HTTP First)**

- **Auth**: per-node key (rotatable), HMAC signature header
- **Validation**: Zod on body, hard drop on unknown fields
- **Storage**: write to Learning Ledger (append-only tables) in Neon
- **Artifact handling**: large blobs (evidence, diffs) → S3; store only the key in DB
- **Rate limiting**: token bucket per node; backpressure responses

### **3. Learning Ledger (Postgres/Neon)**

Keep it boring and auditable.

```sql
-- schema/001_learning_ledger.sql
create table nodes (
  id text primary key,                 -- node_*
  org_hash text not null,              -- salted hash
  stack text not null,                 -- react|svelte|...
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table dna_versions (
  id text primary key,                 -- dna_*
  semver text not null,
  manifest jsonb not null,             -- rules/weights/flags
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table signals (
  id bigserial primary key,
  node_id text references nodes(id),
  dna_id text references dna_versions(id),
  kind text check (kind in ('violation','gap','friction')),
  blueprint_id text,
  payload jsonb not null,              -- validated, redacted
  occurred_at timestamptz not null,
  received_at timestamptz default now()
) partition by range (received_at);

create index signals_kind_time on signals(kind, received_at);
create index signals_blueprint on signals(blueprint_id);

create table patterns (
  id text primary key,                 -- pat_*
  signature text not null,             -- stable hash of dimensions
  meta jsonb not null,                 -- support & distribution
  first_seen timestamptz not null,
  last_seen timestamptz not null
);

create table amendments (
  id text primary key,                 -- amd_*
  source_pattern text references patterns(id),
  proposal jsonb not null,             -- diff against dna manifest
  status text check (status in ('draft','vote','ratified','rejected')) not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table votes (
  amendment_id text references amendments(id),
  node_id text references nodes(id),
  weight numeric not null,             -- reputation-weighted later
  choice text check (choice in ('yes','no','abstain')) not null,
  reason text,
  cast_at timestamptz default now(),
  primary key (amendment_id, node_id)
);
```

### **4. OLAP Sidecar (When Needed)**

- **ClickHouse** for cheap, fast aggregates over billions of rows
- **Ingest**: nightly (or streaming) ETL from Postgres signals → ClickHouse
- **Use**: clustering, cohorting, time-series anomaly detection

### **5. Pattern Miner & Proposal Engine**

- **Miner**: jobs that roll up signals to candidate patterns (support >= N across distinct nodes)
- **Proposal Engine**: bundles a DNA diff (JSON patch) + rationale + evidence links

```
// services/miner/src/minePatterns.ts
// 1) fetch windows of signals, 2) cluster by (blueprint_id, rule, stack, dna),
// 3) compute support/cross-node distribution, 4) upsert patterns

// services/proposals/src/generateAmendment.ts
// build JSON Patch against current dna.manifest -> add rule, adjust severity, add template Blueprint, etc.
```

### **6. Consensus & Ratification**

- **Voting**: one node, one vote to start; add reputation weighting later
- **Thresholds**: configurable per amendment type (simple majority across ≥K distinct orgs)
- **Outcome**: on ratify → bump DNA semver, publish manifest, notify nodes

### **7. DNA Propagation**

- **Artifact**: versioned Aegis-dna package (JSON manifest) + changelog
- **Distribution**: CDN + npm package + signed ETAG endpoint
- **Node behavior**: SDK checks for updates on heartbeat; applies flags/rules locally; reports back compliance

## 🔒 **Privacy, Security, Compliance**

### **Privacy Posture:**

- **"Never send what you wouldn't email to a stranger"**
- SDK strips, hashes, or buckets fields; context is schema-guarded
- Org identifiers salted per-org; k-anonymity checks before pattern publication

### **Security:**

- **Attestation**: sign DNA manifests; include signature verification in SDK
- **Abuse controls**: per-node quotas, anomaly detection on spammy nodes
- **Auth**: per-node keys with HMAC signatures

### **Compliance:**

- **GDPR compliance**: anonymized aggregation, right to deletion
- **Audit trails**: complete Constitutional decision history
- **Governance transparency**: all amendments public with rationale

---

## 🗳️ **Democratic Mechanics**

### **Amendment Types:**

- **Rule tweak**: adjust severity or enforcement
- **New Blueprint**: add Constitutional pattern
- **Enforcement level change**: modify governance strictness
- **Deprecation**: sunset outdated rules

### **Voting System:**

- **Quorum**: X distinct orgs + Y total nodes
- **Cool-down period** for objections
- **Reputation weighting** (v2): weight by signal quality and diversity

### **Consensus Thresholds:**

```
amendment_thresholds:
  rule_tweak:
    nodes: 10
    orgs: 3
    majority: "simple"
  new_blueprint:
    nodes: 20
    orgs: 5
    majority: "supermajority"
  enforcement_change:
    nodes: 30
    orgs: 7
    majority: "supermajority"
```
