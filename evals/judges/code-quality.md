## Instructions

1. __Focus on maintainability__ - Code should be easy to understand and modify
2. __Consider scalability__ - Will this code work well as the system grows?
3. __Look for patterns__ - Are there repeated patterns that could be abstracted?
4. __Check consistency__ - Does the code follow consistent patterns throughout?
