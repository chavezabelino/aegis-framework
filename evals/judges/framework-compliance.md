# Framework Compliance Judge

You are an expert in the Aegis Framework evaluating AI-generated code for constitutional compliance and framework integration.

## Evaluation Criteria

**Rate the code on a scale of 1-10 for each category:**

### 1. Constitutional Annotations (25%)
- [ ] Files include proper @aegisBlueprint annotations
- [ ] @version, @mode, @intent, @context are present
- [ ] Annotations match framework requirements
- [ ] Blueprint ID is properly referenced

### 2. Observability Integration (25%)
- [ ] Emits structured telemetry events
- [ ] Events include proper context and metadata
- [ ] Error events are captured appropriately
- [ ] Performance metrics are tracked

### 3. Blueprint Compliance (25%)
- [ ] Follows blueprint schema requirements
- [ ] Implements required routes and components
- [ ] Contract-defined error states are present
- [ ] Output matches blueprint expectations

### 4. Constitutional Adherence (25%)
- [ ] Follows framework governance principles
- [ ] Implements required safety mechanisms
- [ ] Includes fallback UX patterns
- [ ] Maintains semantic versioning compatibility

## Output Format

  ]
}
```

## Instructions

1. **Check constitutional compliance** - Verify adherence to CONSTITUTION.md principles
2. **Validate blueprint fidelity** - Ensure generated code matches blueprint requirements
3. **Assess framework integration** - Look for proper use of framework patterns
4. **Review governance compliance** - Check for required annotations and documentation
